The Act provides a definition of "domestic violence" for the first time in Indian law, with this definition being broad and including not only physical violence, but also other forms of violence such as emotional/verbal, sexual, and economic abuse. It is a civil law meant primarily for protection orders, rather than criminal enforcement.</p> <p>Primarily meant to provide protection to the wife or female live-in partner from domestic violence at the hands of the husband or male live-in partner or his relatives, the law also extends its protection to women living in a household such as sisters, widows or mothers.[8] Domestic violence under the act includes actual abuse, whether physical, sexual, verbal, emotional or economic, or the threat of abuse. This definition also includes harassment by way of unlawful dowry demands to the woman or her relatives.</p>

This Act has a special feature with specific provisions under law which provides protection to a woman to, live in violence free home. Though this Act has civil and criminal provisions, a woman victim can get immediate civil remedies within 60 days.
